# Movie App

## Description

Duration: 72 hours - evening 11/5/2020 - evening 11/8/2020

This project is an app that contains movies and uses saga function to display them, handling the request to the server from the client.  The app contains a home page, which lists all movies currently in the database.  It also has a detais page that will be shown when a movie image is clicked on.  Lastly, there is a page to add a new movie, including the title, a url location for an image, a description, and up to five genres that apply to the movie.

The project had a fair number of challenges, including forcing images inside a button, and handling up to five genres added by the user.  The button took some work, and a lot of troubleshooting.  The ability to take in multiple genres did not seem hard to tackle in my head, and I tried many things, both to make the client side code work, as well as the post route code work in the router, and I got errors from many of the things that I thought would work, so in the end, I decided the best thing was going to be to make it work with really long, and ugly code that functions properly.
